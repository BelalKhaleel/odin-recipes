      <h1>Lasagna</h1>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of
        very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish
        made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as
        ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted during
        baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients
        and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into
        single-serving square or rectangular portions.

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add onion and garlic, cooking for
              5 minutes until softened. Next, add mince and brown thoroughly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stir in tomatoes and sprinkle dried oregano over the mixture.
              Simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce
              thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
              Preheat oven to 180°C and grease a medium ovenproof baking dish.
              Arrange ¼ of the Lasagna sheets on the base, trimming them as
              needed to fit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spoon 1/3 of the mince mixture over the Lasagna sheets and cover
              with a generous layer of béchamel sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
              Repeat the layering process twice more. Top the final layer of
              béchamel sauce with Lasagna sheets and spread the remaining
              béchamel over them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sprinkle cheese over the top and bake for 30-40 minutes until the
              pasta is tender and cheese turns golden brown. If needed, cover
              the dish with foil during baking to prevent the cheese from
              burning.
