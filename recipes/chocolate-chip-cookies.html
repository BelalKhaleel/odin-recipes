    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment
        paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar,
        and brown sugar until light and fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
        Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until
        just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the
        dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet,
        spacing them about 2 inches apart.
      </li>
      <li>Bake for 9 to 11 minutes or until golden brown around the edges.</li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a
        few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
